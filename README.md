# Deep's Notes 📝

Welcome to my little corner of thoughts and musings. This repository is filled with random ideas, scripts, and half-baked projects.

## What's Inside?

Quick notes, rapid-fire ideas, and brainstorms that may or may not make sense.

## Use with Caution

These notes are like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. They might inspire, confuse, or entertain you. Or all of the above.
